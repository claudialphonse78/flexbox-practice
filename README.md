 # Flexbox
>This is a practice repo for flexbox and exercises based on it

 We can use an emmet shortcut to do this
`.container>.box.box1*10`
- We are using `normailize.css` which resets the default browser settings to make  our code have the same look across browsers
- without flexbox the elements i.e. div tags are stacked on top of each other

- To start using flexbox we simply have to write `display:flex` on the parent container
using flex we get and our flex container goes all the way across

inline-flex will just wrap around the content

- The parent container is called the **flex container** and the immediate children are called **flex items** and we dont explicitly need to define display flex on the children
